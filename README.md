# NUnit Analyzers #

This is a suite of analyzers that target the NUnit testing framework. Right now, the code is separate from the NUnit framework, so if you want to try out the analyzers you'll need to download the code, build it and then use the generated NuGet package in your project. In the future the analyzers may be added as part of the NUnit framework package but that hasn't been done right now.

## License ##

NUnit analyzers are Open Source software and released under the [MIT license](http://www.nunit.org/nuget/nunit3-license.txt), which allow the use of the analyzers in free and commercial applications and libraries without restrictions.

## Contributors ##

Current contributors to the analyzers are [Jason Bock] (https://www.github.com/jasonbock).
